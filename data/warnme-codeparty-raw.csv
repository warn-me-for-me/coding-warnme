   The first Cal football game is this weekend. Let's keep our social gatherings enjoyable for everyone: Practice consent and interrupt unhealthy behavior before it escalates. 
 Get Consent, Respect Boundaries: Practice affirmative consent at all times. Practice acceptance of your own and others’ boundaries. Consent requires an affirmative, conscious, voluntary, and ongoing agreement from each person to engage in every activity, which is always revocable. Alcohol and other substances can impact the ability to give consent. 
 Be Yourself: As you are navigating spaces, think about the choices you are making. You have individual choice and identity; you don’t have to conform to social pressure.
